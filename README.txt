This python code demonstrates higher quality 2D texture font using subpixel
rendering and positioning. You'll need the freetype library with the subpixel
rendering option (FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING in
freetype/config/ftoption.h).

You'll also need the numpy library available from: http://numpy.scipy.org
and the OpenGL python bindings available from: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net

Run the demo.py and enjoy...
